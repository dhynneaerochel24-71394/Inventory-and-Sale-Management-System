Our Inventory and Sales Management System is a Python-based application built with object-oriented programming principles, using an SQLite database to securely store and manage product and sales data, replacing inefficient paper records in small retail and manufacturing businesses. It addresses common issues like inventory imbalances, operational disconnects, and poor forecasting by offering real-time stock tracking, automated alerts for low inventory, and features to add, view, update products, monitor sales transactions, and generate reports. The system simplifies management, reduces errors through automation, and ensures data security, focusing on core functionalities like inventory handling and sales orders while excluding areas like full accounting or HR. Benefits include time savings, cost reductions from optimized stock, improved accuracy, and data-driven decision-making. Stakeholders such as business owners, inventory and sales staff, and customers all benefit from streamlined operations. Ultimately, it provides secure, accessible data storage, better oversight of stock and sales, and demonstrates OOP for reliable, error-minimizing control that drives business growth.
